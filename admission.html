        <p>Lady Of Mercy School is a private institution that provides a comprehensive education for children aged 2 to 11 years. We are committed to nurturing the intellectual, emotional, and social development of our students in a safe and supportive environment.</p>

    <div class="n-card">
      <h2>Equal Opportunity Admission</h2>
      <p> Lady Of Mercy School subscribes to an equal opportunity admission policy, ensuring that pupils of all ethnic, religious, racial, and socio-economic backgrounds can enroll. Admission forms are available on request for a fee.</p>
      <p>All new children—except those under three years of age—are required to sit for an academic test in Mathematics, English, and Science. This assessment helps determine the child’s strengths and weaknesses so that appropriate remedial assistance can be provided as needed.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="n-card">
      <h2>Preferred Age &amp; Admission Process</h2>
      <p>The preferred age for admission is two (2) years. However, pupils of any age transferring from other local or international schools (with proven academic credentials, cumulative records, transfer certificates, and good testimonials) will be admitted after passing the Hilltop admission examination.</p>
      <p>A child’s admission is determined based on the outcome of the test.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="n-card">
      <h2>Fees Policy &amp; Payment Options</h2>
      <p>Timely payment of school fees allows  Lady Of Mercy to make necessary purchases and pay staff salaries. Consistent late payments may lead to actions, including the termination of admission.</p>
      <p>A registration fee is required upon enrolment to cover the administration cost. Note that registration fees are non-refundable. In cases where a child drops out and later re-enrolls after one academic year, the registration fee will be charged again.</p>
      <p>We prefer that school fees be paid via Bankers Draft; however, cheques are accepted for your convenience. Should your cheque be returned due to insufficient funds on two occasions, further action may be taken to recover the fees. Our bankers are available on school premises during the first month of re-opening to receive fees on our behalf.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="n-card">
      <h2>Uniform, Books &amp; Dress Code</h2>
      <p>School uniforms and all relevant books will be provided by Hillview Montessori School. Pupils are expected to wear the prescribed uniform at school and during all school-organized functions.</p>
      <p>The physical education outfit consists of a Lacoste shirt and shorts for boys, or a cotton skirt for girls—in the four primary colors approved by the School. All uniforms are directly sewn by the school; parents are not permitted to alter or sew the school uniform.</p>
      <p>Appropriate footwear includes neat leather shoes (black or brown) or clean leather sandals with white socks. Sneakers or canvas shoes are allowed on Fridays to accommodate games.</p>
      <p>All boys must have their hair neatly combed and kept short, while girls should have their hair neatly combed or braided into corn rolls. Extravagant hairstyles, permed and fancy cuts, colorful nail varnish, lipstick, facial makeup, and other cosmetics are not permitted. Failure to comply with the dress code may result in suspension from the school.</p>
      <p>P.E. uniforms along with gym shoes should be worn during Physical Education classes and on Sports Day. New students are advised to obtain their uniforms as soon as a House is assigned.</p>
